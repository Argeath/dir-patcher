Creates "binary file differences" patches of every file in whole directory.
.PP
Patch file contains data about all differences between "old" and "new" file.
.PP
Patch files are saved in RFC 3284 (VCDIFF) format. (http://www.rfc-base.org/rfc-3284.html)

.I Process:
.PP
1) Directory structure of "SourceNew" is copied to "tmp" and is filled with all new files. ("New" file is that file which is in "SourceNew" but not in "SourceOld").
.PP
2) Then "tmp" directory is compressed to "newfiles.tgz" and removed.
.PP
3) For every file (if it is not "new") in "SourceNew" directory, program creates patch between this file (in "SourceNew") and the one in "SourceOld" and saves it (.patch file) to "out" directory.
.PP
