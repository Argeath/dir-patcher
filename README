Version          : 1.0

Description      :
Creates "binary file differences" patches of every file in whole directory.
Patch file contains data about all differences between "old" and "new" file.
Patch files are saved in RFC 3284 (VCDIFF) format. (http://www.rfc-base.org/rfc-3284.html)
Uses Xdelta3 (apt-get install xdelta3) to create patch, Tar and Gzip to compression.

Process:
1) Directory structure of "SourceNew" is copied to "tmp" and is filled with all new files. ("New" file is that file which is in "SourceNew" but not in "SourceOld").
2) Then "tmp" directory is compressed to "newfiles.tgz" and removed.
3) For every file (if it is not "new") in "SourceNew" directory, program creates patch between this file (in "SourceNew") and the one in "SourceOld" and saves it (.patch file) to "out" directory.
4) Finally, creates a List file containing all patch files.


Options:
-h		        	Help
-v			        Version and Credits
-c              	Specify Config file
-x 			        Creates also List file (mentioned in Process point 4)
-o <directory>		Specify a "SourceOld" directory
-n <directory>		Specify a "SourceNew" directory
-t <directory>		Specify a "out" directory
-z <name>		    Specify a .tgz file name (mentioned in Process point 2)
-l			        Creates only a List file (mentioned in Process point 4)
-g [0-9]		    Changes compression of gzip (0-9 level of compression: 0-none, 9-best)
-p <version>   	 	Packs all output files and specify its version code

Default options are located in config.yaml
